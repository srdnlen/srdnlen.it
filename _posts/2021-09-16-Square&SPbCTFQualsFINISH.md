After a long weekend of CTFs we are proud to announce that we collected two very good results at SPbCTF and at SquareCTF. Furthermore the first ctf allow us to partecipate in another CTF that will take place on the 29th of November and will be an Attack/Defense challenge. We are already looking forward to see what kind of problems we are going to face, stay tuned.
